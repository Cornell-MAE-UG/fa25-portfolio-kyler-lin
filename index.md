## About Me

Hi I'm Kyler, a sophomore at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Robotics. With a strong passion for robotics, CAD design, programming, and circuitry, my interests are driven by the desire to innovate and apply engineering to real-world challenges. 

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve gained hands-on experience in designing mechanical systems, developing control algorithms, and integrating hardware with software to create functional prototypes. As a member and leader in various engineering organizations—from my high school robotics team, to research, to my current project team—I’ve learned the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and creative problem-solving when approaching complex technical challenges. My goal is to contribute to the development of technologies that enhance everyday life and push the limits of robotics innovation. Or to just make something that looks cool.
