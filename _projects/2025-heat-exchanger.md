title: Heat Exchanger
description: A heat exchanger is a device that transfers thermal energy between two fluids without allowing them to mix or come in direct contact. The way this works is that each fluid flows through its own passages that share a common wall made of thermally conductive material, in most cases, it’s metal. For example, the hotter fluid flows on one side of this wall and the cooler fluid flows on the other side, ensuring that there isn’t any mixing happening. Since heat naturally flows from high temperature to low temperature, energy leaves the hot fluid, passes by conduction through the wall, and then enters the cold fluid by convection. As a result, the hot stream is cooled and the cold stream is warmed. In our example, the passages can be defined in two ways. as a parallel flow both fluids move in the same direction, while in counterflow, they move in opposite directions. In the majority of cases, the counter-flow allows for more efficient heat transfer because the temperature difference between the streams stays larger along the length of the exchanger. In addition, some heat exchangers don’t just have a flat wall between the liquids; there could be extra shapes on the surface. An example of these shapes is extra plates, fins, and corrugations; these shapes increase the amount of surface area where the hot and cold fluids touch the metal. This is important because the more surface area there is, the more room for heat to flow across, allowing for better heat transfer. Moreover, some applications of heat exchangers in the real world are automotive radiators, refrigerators, HVAC systems, and power plants. As all these systems are considered heat exchangers to help hit their ultimate goal of transferring thermal energy.
